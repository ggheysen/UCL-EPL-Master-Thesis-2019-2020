In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in the image detection and recognition applications. However, they require intensive CPU operations and memory bandwidth that make general CPUs fail to achieve the desired performance levels. Consequently, hardware accelerators that use application-specific integrated circuits, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and graphic processing units have been employed to improve the throughput of CNNs. More precisely, FPGAs have been recently adopted for accelerating the implementation of deep learning networks due to their ability to maximize parallelism and their energy efficiency. In this paper, we review the recent existing techniques for accelerating deep learning networks on FPGAs. We highlight the key features employed by the various techniques for improving the acceleration performance. In addition, we provide recommendations for enhancing the utilization of FPGAs for CNNs acceleration. The techniques investigated in this paper represent the recent trends in the FPGA-based accelerators of deep learning networks. Thus, this paper is expected to direct the future advances on efficient hardware accelerators and to be useful for deep learning researchers.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs) have gained popularity in many complicated computer vision applications. Many customized accelerators based on FPGAs are proposed for 2D CNNs, while very few are for 3D CNNs. Three-D CNNs are far more computationally intensive and the design space for 3D CNN acceleration has been further expanded since one more dimension is introduced, making it a big challenge to accelerate 3D CNNs on FPGAs. Motivated by the finding that the computation patterns of 2D and 3D CNNs are very similar, we propose a uniform architecture design for accelerating both 2D and 3D CNNs in this paper. The uniform architecture is based on the idea of mapping convolutions to matrix multiplications. A customized mapping module is developed to generate the feature matrix tilings with no need to store the entire enlarged feature matrix on-chip or off-chip, a splitting strategy is adopted to reconstruct a convolutional layer to adapt to the on-chip memory capacity, and a 2D multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) array is adopted to compute matrix multiplications efficiently. For demonstration, we implement an accelerator prototype with a high-level synthesis (HLS) methodology on a Xilinx VC709 board and test the accelerator on three typical CNN models: AlexNet, VGG16, and C3D. Experimental results show that the accelerator achieves state-of-the-art throughput performance on both 2D and 3D CNNs, with much better energy efficiency than the CPU and GPU.},

	abstract = {If we are eventually to understand the capability of higher organisms for perceptual recognition, generalization, recall, and thinking, we must first have answers to three fundamental questions: 1. How is information about the physical world sensed, or detected, by the biological system? 2. In what form is information stored, or remembered? 3. How does information contained in storage, or in memory, influence recognition and behavior? The first of these questions is in the province of sensory physiology, and is the only one for which appreciable understanding has been achieved. This article will be concerned primarily with the second and third questions, which are still subject to a vast amount of speculation, and where the few relevant facts currently supplied by neurophysiology have not yet been integrated into an acceptable theory. With regard to the second question, two alternative positions have been maintained. The first suggests that storage of sensory information is in the form of coded representations or images, with some sort of one-to-one mapping between the sensory stimulus 1 The development of this theory has been carried out at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, Inc., under the sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research, Contract Nonr-2381(00).

Some of the exciting application areas of CNN include Image Classification and Segmentation, Object Detection, Video Processing, Natural Language Processing, and Speech Recognition. The powerful learning ability of deep CNN is primarily due to the use of multiple feature extraction stages that can automatically learn representations from the data. The availability of a large amount of data and improvement in the hardware technology has accelerated the research in CNNs, and recently interesting deep CNN architectures have been reported. Several inspiring ideas to bring advancements in CNNs have been explored, such as the use of different activation and loss functions, parameter optimization, regularization, and architectural innovations. However, the significant improvement in the representational capacity of the deep CNN is achieved through architectural innovations. Notably, the ideas of exploiting spatial and channel information, depth and width of architecture, and multi-path information processing have gained substantial attention. Similarly, the idea of using a block of layers as a structural unit is also gaining popularity. This survey thus focuses on the intrinsic taxonomy present in the recently reported deep CNN architectures and, consequently, classifies the recent innovations in CNN architectures into seven different categories. These seven categories are based on spatial exploitation, depth, multi-path, width, feature-map exploitation, channel boosting, and attention. Additionally, the elementary understanding of CNN components, current challenges, and applications of CNN are also provided.},

	abstract = {Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of applications. However, deeper CNN models, which are usually computation consuming, are widely required for complex Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks. Though recent research progress on network compression such as pruning has emerged as a promising direction to mitigate computational burden, existing accelerators are still prevented from completely utilizing the benefits of leveraging sparsity owing to the irregularity caused by pruning. On the other hand, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have been regarded as a promising hardware platform for CNN inference acceleration. However, most existing FPGA accelerators focus on dense CNN and cannot address the irregularity problem. In this paper, we propose a sparse wise dataflow to skip the cycles of processing Multiply-and-Accumulates (MACs) with zero weights and exploit data statistics to minimize energy through zeros gating to avoid unnecessary computations. The proposed sparse wise dataflow leads to a low bandwidth requirement and a high data sharing. Then we design an FPGA accelerator containing a Vector Generator Module (VGM) which can match the index between sparse weights and input activations according to the proposed dataflow. Experimental results demonstrate that our implementation can achieve 987 imag/s and 48 imag/s performance for AlexNet and VGG-16 on Xilinx ZCU102, respectively, which provides 1.5x to 6.7x speedup and 2.0x to 6.2x energy-efficiency over previous CNN FPGA accelerators.},

We introduce a new class of fast algorithms for convolutional neural networks using Winograd's minimal filtering algorithms. The algorithms compute minimal complexity convolution over small tiles, which makes them fast with small filters and small batch sizes.

We also describe efficient ways of applying these mobile models to object detection in a novel framework we call SSDLite. Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which we call Mobile DeepLabv3. The MobileNetV2 architecture is based on an inverted residual structure where the input and output of the residual block are thin bottleneck layers opposite to traditional residual models which use expanded representations in the input an MobileNetV2 uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features in the intermediate expansion layer. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design. Finally, our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness of the transformation, which provides a convenient framework for further analysis. We measure our performance on Imagenet classification, COCO object detection, VOC image segmentation.

This paper presents the design of a frequency-domain accelerator for energy-efficient CNN training. With Fourier representations of parameters, we replace convolutions with simpler pointwise multiplications. To eliminate the Fourier transforms at every layer, we train the network entirely in the frequency domain using approximate frequency-domain nonlinear operations. We further reduce computation and memory requirements using sinc interpolation and Hermitian symmetry. The accelerator is designed and synthesized in 28nm CMOS, as well as prototyped in an FPGA. The simulation results show that the proposed accelerator significantly reduces training time and energy for a target recognition accuracy.},

Current computing systems are not able to run deep network models in real-time with low power consumption. In this paper we present nn-X: a scalable, low-power coprocessor for enabling real-time execution of deep neural networks. nn-X is implemented on programmable logic devices and comprises an array of configurable processing elements called collections. These collections perform the most common operations in deep networks: convolution, subsampling and non-linear functions. The nn-X system includes 4 high-speed direct memory access interfaces to DDR3 memory and two ARM Cortex-A9 processors. Each port is capable of a sustained throughput of 950 MB/s in full duplex. nn-X is able to achieve a peak performance of 227 G-ops/s, a measured performance in deep learning applications of up to 200 G-ops/s while consuming less than 4 watts of power. This translates to a performance per power improvement of 10 to 100 times that of conventional mobile and desktop processors.},

Since CNN feed forward propagation involves highly regular parallel computation, it benefits from a significant speed-up when running on fine grain parallel programmable logic devices. As a consequence, several studies have proposed FPGA-based accelerators for CNNs. However, because of the large computationalpower required by CNNs, none of the previous studies has proposed a direct mapping of the CNN onto the physical resources of an FPGA, allocating each processing actor to its own hardware instance.In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of the so called direct hardware mapping (DHM) and discuss several tactics we explore to make DHM usable in practice. As a proof of concept, we introduce the HADDOC2 open source tool, that automatically transforms a CNN description into a synthesizable hardware description with platform-independent direct hardware mapping.},

The lightweight dataflow (LWDF) programming methodology provides an abstract programming model that supports dataflow-based design and implementation of signal processing hardware and software components and systems. Previous work on LWDF techniques has emphasized their application to DSP software implementation. In this paper, we present new extensions of the LWDF methodology for effective integration with hardware description languages (HDLs), and we apply these extensions to develop efficient methods for low power DSP hardware implementation.

	abstract = {Recent research on deep neural networks has focused primarily on improving accuracy. For a given accuracy level, it is typically possible to identify multiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller DNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller DNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller DNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller DNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small DNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. Additionally, with model compression techniques we are able to compress SqueezeNet to less than 0.5MB (510x smaller than AlexNet). The SqueezeNet architecture is available for download here: https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00149},
	abstract = {Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware resources. To address this limitation, we introduce "deep compression", a three stage pipeline: pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding, that work together to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks by 35x to 49x without affecting their accuracy. Our method first prunes the network by learning only the important connections. Next, we quantize the weights to enforce weight sharing, finally, we apply Huffman coding. After the first two steps we retrain the network to fine tune the remaining connections and the quantized centroids. Pruning, reduces the number of connections by 9x to 13x; Quantization then reduces the number of bits that represent each connection from 32 to 5. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the storage required by AlexNet by 35x, from 240MB to 6.9MB, without loss of accuracy. Our method reduced the size of VGG-16 by 49x from 552MB to 11.3MB, again with no loss of accuracy. This allows fitting the model into on-chip SRAM cache rather than off-chip DRAM memory. Our compression method also facilitates the use of complex neural networks in mobile applications where application size and download bandwidth are constrained. Benchmarked on CPU, GPU and mobile GPU, compressed network has 3x to 4x layerwise speedup and 3x to 7x better energy efficiency.},

	title = {Learning {Transferable} {Architectures} for {Scalable} {Image} {Recognition}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012},
	abstract = {Developing neural network image classification models often requires significant architecture engineering. In this paper, we study a method to learn the model architectures directly on the dataset of interest. As this approach is expensive when the dataset is large, we propose to search for an architectural building block on a small dataset and then transfer the block to a larger dataset. The key contribution of this work is the design of a new search space (the "NASNet search space") which enables transferability. In our experiments, we search for the best convolutional layer (or "cell") on the CIFAR-10 dataset and then apply this cell to the ImageNet dataset by stacking together more copies of this cell, each with their own parameters to design a convolutional architecture, named "NASNet architecture". We also introduce a new regularization technique called ScheduledDropPath that significantly improves generalization in the NASNet models. On CIFAR-10 itself, NASNet achieves 2.4\% error rate, which is state-of-the-art. On ImageNet, NASNet achieves, among the published works, state-of-the-art accuracy of 82.7\% top-1 and 96.2\% top-5 on ImageNet. Our model is 1.2\% better in top-1 accuracy than the best human-invented architectures while having 9 billion fewer FLOPS - a reduction of 28\% in computational demand from the previous state-of-the-art model. When evaluated at different levels of computational cost, accuracies of NASNets exceed those of the state-of-the-art human-designed models. For instance, a small version of NASNet also achieves 74\% top-1 accuracy, which is 3.1\% better than equivalently-sized, state-of-the-art models for mobile platforms. Finally, the learned features by NASNet used with the Faster-RCNN framework surpass state-of-the-art by 4.0\% achieving 43.1\% mAP on the COCO dataset.},

	abstract = {Developing high performance embedded vision applications requires balancing run-time performance with energy constraints. Given the mix of hardware accelerators that exist for embedded computer vision (e.g. multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs), and their associated vendor optimized vision libraries, it becomes a challenge for developers to navigate this fragmented solution space. To aid with determining which embedded platform is most suitable for their application, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of the run-time performance and energy efficiency of a wide range of vision kernels. We discuss rationales for why a given underlying hardware architecture innately performs well or poorly based on the characteristics of a range of vision kernel categories. Specifically, our study is performed for three commonly used HW accelerators for embedded vision applications: ARM57 CPU, Jetson TX2 GPU and ZCU102 FPGA, using their vendor optimized vision libraries: OpenCV, VisionWorks and xfOpenCV. Our results show that the GPU achieves an energy/frame reduction ratio of 1.1-3.2x compared to the others for simple kernels. While for more complicated kernels and complete vision pipelines, the FPGA outperforms the others with energy/frame reduction ratios of 1.2-22.3x. It is also observed that the FPGA performs increasingly better as a vision application's pipeline complexity grows.},
