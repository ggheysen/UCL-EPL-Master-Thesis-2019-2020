In the previous chapter, we have introduced pruning, which can reduce both the size and the computational complexity of a \acrshort{cnn}. We have also seen that there exist various pruning schemes. Each of them can be categorized from coarse-grained to fine-grained. Coarse-grained pruning schemes have the advantage of being easily implemented on \acrshort{gpu} and \acrshort{cpu} in exchange for a drop of accuracy. On the opposite, fine-grained pruning schemes have better accuracy but create irregular access pattern that makes them difficult to implement. To have an efficient \acrshort{fpga}-based architecture, we should focus on implementing the most fine-grained pruning possible in order to have a higher sparsity and limit the drop of accuracy. This shows the advantage of using \acrshort{fpga} accelerator because, as said previously, this type of pruning scheme is not easily implementable on \acrshort{cpu} and \acrshort{gpu}

In order to further reduce the number of weights and operations, we will define an accelerator \acrshort{fpga}-based architecture that integrates both pruning and \acrshort{dsc}. The objectives of the architecture and its associated pruning scheme are the following:
%
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The pruning scheme is as fine-grained as possible.
    \item The pruning scheme reduces the computational complexity.
    \item The pruning scheme allows a reduction of the memory required to store the weights.
    \item The proposed architecture provides a logically correct output.
    \item An increase of the sparsity does not degrade the performance of the architecture.
\end{enumerate}
%
First, Section \ref{sec:design} aims at developping the pruning scheme and the algorithm to handle it. We then perform a loop analysis to determine the hardware design variables.

Second, Section \ref{sec:implementation} describes the implementation of the accelerator \acrshort{fpga}-based architecture and details its dataflow.

Third, Section \ref{sec:measure} shows the results obtained and discusses the limits of the implementation.
