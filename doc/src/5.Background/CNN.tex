    \chapter{Convolutional Neural Network} \label{chap:cnn}
A \acrfull{cnn} is a type of \acrlong{nn} that is specialized in analyzing visual imagery. It has shown explemplary performance on serveral competitions related to Computer Vision and Image Processing \cite{khan_survey_2020}. \newline \newline
The first section introduces the building blocks of a \acrshort{cnn}. We start from the first and most simple element and then show the improvements. \newline \newline
The second section is concentrated on the training of a \acrshort{cnn}. \newline \newline
The third section details various models and techniques to perform model compression.

    \section{Layers}
A layer is a high-level build block in \acrshort{dl}. It is a set of operations, weights and non-linear functions. It transforms an input into an output which will be used as input for another layer. The collections of layer is then used to build a \acrlong{cnn}. We begin our understanding of the layer theory by explaining the perceptron, the simplest element of a neural Network.
