\section{Loop optimization techniques} \label{sec:loopopti}
\acrfull{simd} accelerators were proposed to solve the static systolic array inefficiency. The general computation flow can be described as follow:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Fetch \acrshort{fm}s and weights from the external memory (\acrshort{dram}) to on-chip buffer.
    \item The \acrshort{fm}s and weights are streamed into the \acrshort{pe}.
    \item
\end{enumerate}
