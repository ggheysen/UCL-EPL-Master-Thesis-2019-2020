\chapter{Background} \label{chap:background}
In the frame of this thesis, knowledge about \acrshort{cnn} and \acrshort{fpga} is required. The purpose of this chapter is then to detail all the background information.

First, Section \ref{sec:cnn} develops the theory behind \acrshort{cnn}. We explore how such a model can be constructed, what are the state-of-the-art models and how can we train a \acrshort{cnn}.

Finally, Section \ref{sec:fpga} explains what is a \acrshort{fpga} and what are its main components. We also detail the \acrshort{fpga} design flow.

    \textbf{Conclusions about the Background}: \newline \newline
    We have shown in this chapter what is a \acrshort{cnn}, how to build, and train it. We have also seen that the most performing models have a huge computational complexity and memory utilization, which limits the implementation of such models on mobile platforms, such as \acrshort{fpga}. We have also seen what is an \acrshort{fpga}, what are its components, and how to construct a hardware design on it.
