\chapter{Background} \label{chap:background}
In this chapter we review all required information needed to understand the rest of the thesis.

We develop in Secion \ref{sec:cnn} the theory behind \acrshort{cnn}s and the various optimizations to apply on networks to implement them on a \acrshort{fpga}. 

Section \ref{sec:fpga} explains what is a \acrshort{fpga} and what are its main components. We also detail the \acrshort{fpga} design flow.

\vspace{5mm}
We have seen in this chapter what is a \acrshort{cnn}, how to build, and train it. We have also seen that the most performing models have a huge computational complexity and memory utilization, which limit the implementation of such models on mobile platforms, such as \acrshort{fpga}. We have also seen what is an \acrshort{fpga}, what are its components and how to construct an hardware design on it.
