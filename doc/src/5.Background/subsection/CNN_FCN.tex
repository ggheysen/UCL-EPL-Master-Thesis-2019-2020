\subsection{Fully Connected layer} \label{subs:fcl}
The perceptron of section \ref{subs:perceptron} can be considered as a linear classifier for which the decision boundary is the hyperplane, as seen in equation \eqref{eq:linearclassifer}.
%
\begin{equation}
    b + w_1 \cdot x_1 + ... + w_{n_{in}} \cdot x_{n_{in}} = 0
    \label{eq:linearclassifer}
\end{equation}
%
We can understand why the perceptron is limited because it has only a linear decision boundary. For example, we can implement the AND and OR Boolean functions using a perceptron, but it is impossible to learn the XOR function. To have a non-linear model, we must use a topology of perceptrons. The topology is composed of layers of perceptrons, where each layer, in the case of a \acrshort{cnn}, is called a \textbf{fully-connected layer}. We can see an example in figure \ref{fig:fcn}.

In the fully-connected layer, each neuron is connected to all the inputs or neurons of previous layers (as the name suggests). Usually, the fully-connected layers are placed at the end of the \acrshort{cnn}. It takes the extracted features from the previous layersas input, which are converted as a one-dimension output \acrshort{fm}. Afterwards, it makes a non-linear classification of them \cite{khan_survey_2020}.

A fully-connected layer is characterized by the number of neurons, activation functions, and the values of weights. The output vector $\boldsymbol{y}$ can be expressed using equation \eqref{eq:fcn}, where $\boldsymbol{x}$ is the vector of the input of the layer and $x_0 = 1$ is the bias;   $\boldsymbol{w}$ is the vector of all the weights of the layer ($w^i_*$ are the weights of the ith perceptron and $w^*_0$ are the biases); $h$ is the activation function of the layer.
%
\begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol{y} = h(\boldsymbol{w}^T \boldsymbol{x}) \Leftrightarrow \forall o \in \{ 1, ..., N_{out} \} : y_o = h(\sum^{N_{in}}_{i=0} w^o_i \cdot x_i)
    \label{eq:fcn}
\end{equation}
%
As we have seen that perceptrons can be used to construct non-linear classifier, we see in the next section \ref{subs:2dconv} the main operation in the \acrshort{cnn}: the \textbf{convolution}, which extracts the feature from input images.
