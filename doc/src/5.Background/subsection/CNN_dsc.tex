\subsubsection{Depthwise Separable Convolution}  \label{subs:dsc}
\acrfull{dsc} was first introduced by \textcite{sifre_rigid-motion_2014}. According to \textcite{chollet_xception_2017}, \textquote{\textit{A depthwise separable convolution consists in a \textbf{depthwise convolution}, i.e. a spatial convolution performed independently over each channel of an input, followed by a \textbf{pointwise convolution}, i.e. a $1 \times 1$ convolution, projecting the channel's output by the depthwise convolution onto a new channel space}}.

It means that the \acrshort{dsc} is composed of a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:dsc}. This alternative form of convolution was developed to reduce efficiently the number of weights and the arithmetic complexity, in exchange for a limited loss of accuracy \cite{liu_fpga-based_2019}. As a result, the \acrshort{dsc} has significantly fewer parameters and operations to the standard convolution, which was described previously. Equations \eqref{eq:descopred} and \eqref{eq:descwgred} are used to express the reduction factors on weights and operations, where $F_{*}$ are the reduction factors, $W_{sc}$ and $O_{sc}$ (resp. $W_{dsc}$ and $O_{dsc}$) are the weights and operations required for a standard convolution (resp. \acrshort{dsc}) \cite{liu_fpga-based_2019, bai_cnn_2018}.

\begin{equation}
    F_w = \frac{W_{dsc}}{W_{sc}} =
    \frac{N_{kx} \times N_{ky} \times N_{if} + N_{if} \times N_{of}}{N_{kx} \times N_{ky} \times N_{if} \times N_{of}} =
    \frac{1}{N_{of}} + \frac{1}{N_{kx} \times N_{ky}}
    \label{eq:descopred}
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        F_o &= \frac{O_{dsc}}{O_{sc}} = \frac{N_{kx} \times N_{ky} \times N_{if} \times N_{ox} \times N_{oy} + N_{if} \times N_{of} \times N_{ox} \times N_{oy}}{N_{kx} \times N_{ky} \times N_{if} \times N_{of} \times N_{ox} \times N_{oy}} \\
        &= \frac{1}{N_{of}} + \frac{1}{N_{kx} \times N_{ky}}
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:descwgred}
\end{equation}

Using Equation \eqref{eq:descopred}, Equation \eqref{eq:descwgred}, and $3 \times 3$ kernels, the reduction factors of computational complexity and weights are about 9 times (in comparison with the standard convolution) \cite{zhang_channel_2019}.
