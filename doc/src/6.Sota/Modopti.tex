\section{CNN optimizations on FPGA} \label{sec:opti_dataflow}
%
%
Section \ref{sec:fpga} provided a general layout of what is an \acrshort{fpga} and how did it work. This section is focused on how to implement a given model on an \acrshort{fpga}, and what hardware optimizations can be made to accelerate the inference.

Section \ref{sec:dt_general} reviews de various approaches to perform an efficient inference of a general \acrshort{cnn} on \acrshort{fpga}. 

Section \ref{subsec:impl_dsc} gives an overview of how to perform \acrshort{dsc} on \acrshort{fpga} and Section \ref{subsec:impl_prun} is focused on successful \acrshort{fpga}-based architecture that implemented pruning.
